<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contrast to the main project, the <code>plc4x-build-tools</code> repository contains a loose collection of sub-projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main <code>pom.xml</code> in the root directory is mainly for allowing to import all modules into an IDE and shouldn&#8217;t be used for releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to release a part of the build-tools, please execute the following release steps in the parts sub-directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general the preparation steps for releasing a build-tool is equal to those of the main project.
So please check <a href="release.html">here</a> (Chapters: <code>Preparing your system for being able to release</code> and <code>Preparing the codebase for a release</code>)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rest of the steps are a lot simpler than those of the main project as there aren&#8217;t any profiles involved.</p>

<h3 id="creating_a_release_branch_for_the_code_generation_module">Creating a release branch (For the code-generation module)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to SemVer, we have: Major, Minor and Bugfix releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each new Major and Minor release we create a new branch at the beginning of a code-freeze phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So if currently the project version in develop is <code>1.8.0-SNAPSHOT</code>, we create a branch <code>release/1.8</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When creating the branch is exactly the moment in which the version in <code>develop</code> is incremented to the next minor version.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can and should be automated by the <code>maven-release-plugin</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Per default the plugin will ask for the working copy version during the build execution.
This is the version the <code>develop</code> branch will be changed to.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>mvn release:branch -DbranchName=releases/code-generation/{minor-version}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Per default the plugin suggests the next bugfix version as working version, however we want it to use the next minor version.
So in case of preparing the release branch for <code>1.8.0</code> the command would be the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>   mvn release:branch -DbranchName=releases/code-generation/1.8</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plugin will then aks for the version:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>   What is the new working copy version for "PLC4X Build Tools: Code Generation"? (org.apache.plc4x.plugins:plc4x-code-generation) 1.8.1-SNAPSHOT: : 1.9.0-SNAPSHOT</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where the suggested default is manually overridden.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This step now should perform quite quickly as no build and no tests are involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However in the end the versions of the <code>develop</code> branch are updated and a new <code>releases/code-generation/1.8</code> branch is created.</p>

<p>As especially when switching a lot between different branches, it is recommended to do a clean checkout of the repository.
Otherwise, a lot of directories can be left over, which would be included in the source-release zip.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it is important to check that nowhere else SNAPSHOT versions are referenced.</p>

<p>The way things are set up in the apache parent pom, is that release artifacts are deployed to a so-called <code>staging repository</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can think of a <code>staging repository</code> as a dedicated repository created on the fly as soon as the first artifact comes in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the build you will have a nice and clean Maven repository at <a href="https://repository.apache.org/" class="bare">https://repository.apache.org/</a> that contains only artifacts from the current build.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the build it is important to log in to <code>Nexus</code> at <a href="https://repository.apache.org/" class="bare">https://repository.apache.org/</a>, select <code>Staging Repositories</code> and find the repository with the name: <code>orgapacheplc4x-{somenumber}</code>.</p>
</div>

<p>As soon as it&#8217;s finished, we are done on the Maven side and ready to continue with the rest of the release process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A release build also produces a so-called <code>source-assembly</code> zip.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This contains all sources of the project and will be what&#8217;s actually the release from an Apache point of view and will be the thing we will be voting on.</p>

   [VOTE] Apache PLC4X Build-Tools Code-Generation 1.8.0 RC1

   Message:
   Apache PLC4X Build-Tools Code-Generation 1.8.0 has been staged under [2]
   and it’s time to vote on accepting it for release.

   All Maven artifacts are available under [1]. Voting will be open for 72hr.

   A minimum of 3 binding +1 votes and more binding +1 than binding -1
   are required to pass.

   Repository: https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/plc4x-build-tools.git
   Release tag: releases/code-generation/1.8.0
   Hash for the release tag: {replacethiswiththerealgitcommittag}

   Per [3] "Before voting +1 PMC members are required to download
   the signed source code package, compile it as provided, and test
   the resulting executable on their own platform, along with also
   verifying that the package meets the requirements of the ASF policy

<p>As it is sometimes to do the vote counting, if voting and discussions are going on in the same thread, we send a second email:</p>

<pre>   E-Mail Topic:
   [DISCUSS] Apache PLC4X Build-Tools Code-Generation 1.8.0 RC1

   Message:
   This is the discussion thread for the corresponding VOTE thread.

   Please keep discussions in this thread to simplify the counting of votes.

   If you have to vote -1 please mention a brief description on why and then take the details to this thread.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we have to wait 72 hours till we can announce the result of the vote.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an Apache policy to make it possible for anyone to participate in the vote, no matter where that person lives and not matter what weekends or public holidays might currently be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The vote passes, if at least 3 <code>+1</code> votes are received and more <code>+1</code> are received than <code>-1</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the 72-our minimum wait period is over, and we have fulfilled the requirement of at least 3 +1 votes and more +1 than -1, a final reply is sent to the vote thread with a prefix of <code>[RESULT]</code> in the title in which the summary of the vote is presented in an aggregated form.</p>

<h3 id="releasing_after_a_successful_vote">Releasing after a successful vote</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As soon as the votes are finished, and the results were in favor of a release, the staged artifacts can be released.
This is done by moving them inside the Apache SVN.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>   svn move -m "Release Apache PLC4X 1.8.0" \
       https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/plc4x/build-tools/code-generation/1.8.0/rc1 \
       https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/plc4x/build-tools/code-generation/1.8.0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will make the release artifacts available and will trigger them being copied to mirror sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is also the reason why you should wait at least 24 hours before sending out the release notification emails.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="cleaning_up_older_release_versions">Cleaning up older release versions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a lot of mirrors are serving our releases, it is the Apache policy to clean old releases from the repo if newer versions are released.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be done like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>svn delete https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/plc4x/0.3.0/ -m"deleted version 0.3.0"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this, <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/plc4x" class="bare">https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/plc4x</a> should only contain the latest release directory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="releasing_the_maven_artifacts">Releasing the Maven artifacts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The probably simplest part is releasing the Maven artifacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to do this, the release manager logs into Nexus at <a href="https://repository.apache.org/" class="bare">https://repository.apache.org/</a>, selects the staging repository and clicks on the <code>Release</code> button.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will move all artifacts into the Apache release repository and delete the staging repository after that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All release artifacts released to the Apache release repo, will automatically be synced to Maven central.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="merge_back_release_version_to_release_branch">Merge back release version to <code>release</code> branch</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The `release branch should always point to the last released version.
This has to be done with git</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git checkout release
git merge releases/code-generation/1.8.0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When there are conflicts it could help to use the <code>theirs</code> merge strategy, i.e.,</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git merge -X theirs releases/code-generation/1.8.0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Possibly a manual conflict resolution has to be done afterwards. After that, changes need to
be pushed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contrast to main releases of PLC4X we won&#8217;t do any JIRA version updates, updating of the download page or notifying of the world email to <a href="mailto:announce@apache.org">announce@apache.org</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So now you&#8217;re done. Congrats!</p>
